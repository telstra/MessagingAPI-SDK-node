        When a recipient receives your message, you can choose whether they'll see a privateNumber, Virtual Number or senderName (paid plans only) in the **from** field. If you want to use a Virtual Number, use this endpoint to assign one. Free Trial users can assign one Virtual Number, and those on a paid plan can assign up to 100. 

        Virtual Numbers that have not sent a message in 30 days (Free Trial) or sent/received a message in 18 months (paid plans) will be automatically unassigned from your account. You can check the **lastUse** date of your Virtual Number at any time using GET /virtual-numbers/{virtual-number}.

        Note that Virtual Numbers used in v2 of the Messaging API cannot be used to send messages in v3. Please assign a new Virtual Number instead.

Alternatively, you can use this endpoint to register all 10 numbers.  

        Use this endpoint to register a Free Trial Number to your account. To test out all the features that the trial has to offer, we recommend registering your own mobile number to your Free Trial Numbers list. 

        Note that you can only message mobile numbers that have been added to your Free Trial list and once registered, a Free Trial Number cannot be removed or replaced.

        Request a CSV report of messages (both incoming and outgoing) that have been sent to/from your account within the last three months. You can request details for a specific timeframe, and filter your messages by tags, recipient number or Virtual Number.

        A 201 Created means your report has been queued for generation. Make a note of the reportId returned in the response. You'll need this to check the status of your report and fetch your download link with GET reports/{reportId}. If you supplied a reportCallbackUrl in the request we'll also notify it when your report is ready for download.
