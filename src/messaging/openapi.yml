    ## Free Trial vs Paid Plan Features
    We welcome you to try the Messaging API with our Free Trial. Limited to the first 100 messages. Some features are not available with Free Trial.

    After your Free Trial ends, signing up for a Paid Plan will give you access to the full suite of Messaging API features, namely:
    - Have more than 1 provisioned number
    - Send to ANY eligible recipient mobile number (limited to 5 dedicated recipients only in Free Trial)
    - Send unlimited number of paid messages (limited to 100 in Free Trial)
    - Use alphanumeric sender ID (Australian destinations only)
    - Provision dedicated virtual numbers for up to 5 years (30 days only in Free Trial)

    Check out [the FAQ page](https://dev.telstra.com/support/frequently-asked-questions) for our pricing and process for activating a Paid Plan.

    ## Delivery Status: Notification/Callbacks vs Polling

    The API provides two methods to confirm that a message has been delivered to the destination.

    1. When you send a message there is an opportunity to specify a `notifyURL`. Once the message has been delivered, the API will make a call to this URL to advise of the message status.
    2. If you do not specify a URL you can always call the `GET /status` API to get the status of the message.

    Please see [this blog](https://dev.telstra.com/content/understanding-messaging-api-callbacks-part-1) for more information on using callbacks.

    # Frequently Asked Questions

    **Q: Is creating a subscription via the Provisioning call a required step?**

    A. Yes. You will only be able to start sending messages if you have a provisioned dedicated number. Use Provisioning to create a dedicated number subscription, or renew your dedicated number if it has expired.

    **Q: When trying to send an SMS I receive a `400 Bad Request` or a `404 RESOURCE-NOT-FOUND` response. How can I fix this?**

    A. You need to make sure you have a provisioned dedicated number before you can send an SMS.

    Use Provisioning to create a dedicated number subscription, or renew your dedicated number if it has expired.

    Perform a GET /provisioning/subscriptions call and ensure that your provisioned number is still actively linked to your API key. Otherwise, you will need to perform a POST /provisioning/subscriptions call to re-provision your API MSISDN to your API key.

    If you do not have a provisioned dedicated number and you try to send a message via the API, you will get the error below in the response.

    <pre><code class="language-sh">{
      "status":"400",
      "code":"DELIVERY-IMPOSSIBLE",
      "message":"Invalid \'from\' address specified"
    }</code></pre>

    OR

    <pre><code class="language-sh">{
      "status":"404",
      "code":"RESOURCE-NOT-FOUND",
      "message":"Invalid resource. Refer to API docs at https://dev.telstra.com"
    }</code></pre>

    **Q: How long does my dedicated number stay active for?**

    A. When you provision a dedicated number, by default it will be active for 30 days.
    You can use the `activeDays` parameter during the provisioning call to increment or decrement the number of days your dedicated number will remain active.

    Note that Free Trial apps will have 30 days as the maximum `activeDays` they can add to their provisioned number. If the Provisioning call is made several times within that 30-day period, it will return the `expiryDate` in the Unix format and will not add any activeDays until after that `expiryDate`.

    **Q: Can I send a broadcast message using the Telstra Messaging API?**

    A. Yes. Recipient numbers can be in the form of an array of strings if a broadcast message needs to be sent, allowing you to send to multiple mobile numbers in one API call.
      A sample request body for this will be: `{"to":["+61412345678","+61487654321"],"body":"Test Message"}`

    **Q: How many recipient numbers can I send a broadcast message to at one time?**

    A. The API currently supports up to 10 recipient numbers in the `"to"` array.

    **Q: Can I send SMS and MMS to all countries?**

    A. You can send SMS and MMS to the countries in [this list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/telstra/MessagingAPI-v2/master/docs/Telstra_Messaging_API_Country_Codes.csv), provided the destination network supports delivery.
    International message delivery is on a best-effort basis.
    Messages CANNOT be sent to countries which are subject to global sanctions namely: Burma, Côte d'Ivoire, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria.

    **Q: Can I use `Alphanumeric Identifier` from my paid plan via credit card?**

    A. `Alphanumeric Identifier` is only available on Telstra Account paid plans, not through credit card paid plans.

    **Q: What is the maximum sized MMS that I can send?**

    A. This will depend on the carrier that will receive the MMS. For Telstra, it's up to 2MB. You will need to check with other carriers for their MMS size limits.

    **Q: How is the size of an MMS calculated?**

    A. Images are scaled up to approximately 4/3 when base64 encoded.
    Additionally, there is approximately 200 bytes of overhead on each MMS.
    Assuming the maximum MMS that can be sent on Telstra’s network is 2MB, then the maximum image size that can be sent will be approximately 1.378MB (1.378 x 1.34 + 200, without SOAP encapsulation).

    **Q: How is an MMS classified as Small or Large?**

    A. MMSes with numberSegments below 600 are classed as Small whereas those that are bigger than 600 are classed as Large. They will be charged accordingly.

    **Q: Are SMILs supported by the Messaging API?**

    A. While there will be no error if you send an MMS with a SMIL presentation, the actual layout or sequence defined in the SMIL may not display as expected because most of the new smartphone devices ignore the SMIL presentation layer. SMIL was used in feature phones which had limited capability and SMIL allowed a *powerpoint type* presentation to be provided. Smartphones now have the capability to display video which is the better option for presentations. It is recommended that MMS messages should just drop the SMIL.

    **Q: How do I assign a delivery notification or callback URL?**

    A. You can assign a delivery notification or callback URL by adding the `notifyURL` parameter in the body of the request when you send a message. Once the message has been delivered, a notification will then be posted to this callback URL.

    **Q: Sometimes I am missing delivery receipts, why is this happening?**

    A. Telstra can guarantee delivery receipts are provided for any mobile service connected on Telstra's network so long as the destination handset is able to receive SMS or MMS messages. For other carriers, although messages will be delivered to valid handsets on those carriers, they do not have an obligation to provide delivery receipts back to Telstra.

    **Q: What is the difference between the `notifyURL` parameter in the Provisoning call versus the `notifyURL` parameter in the Send Message call?**

    A. The `notifyURL` in the Provisoning call will be the URL where replies to the provisioned number will be posted.
    On the other hand, the `notifyURL` in the Send Message call will be the URL where the delivery notification will be posted, e.g. when an SMS has already been delivered to the recipient.

    **Q: Is there a specific format for the `notifyURL` parameter?**

    A. The `notifyURL` should be a complete URL address which includes the protocol identifier (e.g. `https://`).
    It should also have a forward slash at the end if it is just a domain (e.g. http://www.example.com/).

    **Q: Can I use Messaging API from my paid plan via credit card billing?**

    A. No. As of 1 June 2020, developers no longer have access to Messaging API production keys with new credit card billing accounts. To access the paid account for Messaging API, you must create a company with a Telstra Billing account number associated. If you are not an existing Telstra customer, or if you are an existing Telstra customer but don't have a 10 digit account number ending in 0, please contact TelstraDev support by emailing telstradev@team.telstra.com and we will help you create a Telstra Account.

    If you already have access to the Messaging API production keys with an existing Credit Card billing method, your account will not be affected by this change. This applies only to accounts created with Credit Card billing after 1 June 2020.

        Invoke the provisioning API to get a dedicated mobile number for an application.

        Note that Free Trial apps will have a 30-Day Limit for their provisioned number. If the Provisioning call is made several times within that 30-Day period, it will return the `expiryDate` in the Unix format and will not add any activeDays until after that `expiryDate`. After the `expiryDate`, you may make another Provisioning call to extend the activeDays by another 30-Days.

        For paid apps, a provisioned number can be allotted for a maximum of 5 years. If a Provisioning call is made which will result to activeDays > 1825, a 409 `Active Days Max` response will be returned to indicate that the provisioned number is already valid for more than 5 years and that no update to activeDays has been made.

        Once activeDays=0, the provisioned number will be quarantined for 90 days after which the number will be made available for other API customers to use. If you wish to continue using the same number, you will need to make another Provisioning call before or within the quarantine period to extend the activeDays. For paid apps, if the Provisioning call is made after the 90-day quarantine period, a different number may be assigned to the app.

        Before sending any messages, Free Trial apps are required to register destination mobile numbers that will be used while trialling Telstra's Messaging API. Up to five destination numbers can be registered. These are the `B numbers`. Any messages sent to numbers NOT on your Free Trial app's registered bnum list will fail.

        Register your max 5 B numbers using this POST call. You can send this POST call multiple times, until the max 5 numbers has been reached. Once 5 B numbers have been registered, there is no way to override them and subsequent attempts to register bnums will fail. You are not able to change the list of registered B numbers after registering 5, so we recommend you include your own number to ensure that you can send and receive meaningful test messages while using the Free Trial. You can check which numbers have been registered by using the below GET /bnum call.
